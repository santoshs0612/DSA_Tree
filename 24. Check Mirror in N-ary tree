Given two n-ary trees. Check if they are mirror images of each other or not. You are also given e denoting the number of edges in both trees, and two arrays, A[] and B[]. Each array has 2*e space separated values u,v denoting an edge from u to v for the both trees.


Example 1:

Input:
n = 3, e = 2
A[] = {1, 2, 1, 3}
B[] = {1, 3, 1, 2}
Output:
1
Explanation:
   1          1
 / \        /  \
2   3      3    2 
As we can clearly see, the second tree
is mirror image of the first.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 3, e = 2
A[] = {1, 2, 1, 3}
B[] = {1, 2, 1, 3}
Output:
0
Explanation:
   1          1
 / \        /  \
2   3      2    3 
As we can clearly see, the second tree
isn't mirror image of the first.
